Title:
How Spam Affects the Sentiment of Tweets

Abstract:
Twitter is a highly influential social media platform that enables users to share and respond to short, real-time messages with a global audience. Despite its popularity, Twitter is not immune to the proliferation of spam content within conversations, particularly on sensitive and controversial social topics like abortion. These topics hold valuable insights as proxies to gauge the sentiments of the general public. However, it has been difficult for researchers to model public opinion on Twitter in real-time while also accounting for the presence of politically charged or noise-infused tweets. Therefore, our objective is to build a pipeline that allows for streaming live tweet data and analyzing the change in sentiment by using spam-filtering models, Naive Bayes and a transfer learning model based on BERT. We will examine and compare the overall sentiment distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment of all tweets and filtered tweets, as well as sentiment compound scores calculated by the NLTK Vader model. This analysis will allow us to better understand the impact of spam presence on public sentiment on social media.
